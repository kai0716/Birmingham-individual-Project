Objective of the Week
- create project page for students and supervisor
- project page status


What I did in this week
Monday - Thursday
In my project, the supervisor can also be a secondmarker, which they could have 2 list of students,
one list for supervised student and one list for second marked student. However, as the supervisor and the secondmarker is 
the same person, and all the students will appear in both lists, which means the
each student will be stored twice in the same database table. However, the student could not appear twice because their email must be unique 
(email is used for login). I have spend four days trying to solve this problem, but still cannot find solution. I am considering to
remove the second marker and continue other function first.
