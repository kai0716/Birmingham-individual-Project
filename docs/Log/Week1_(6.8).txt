Achievements of the Week
Monday
-Repositiory is set up

Tuesday-Thursday
-Research ways of building the application / Read up state of art application
	- Using Java
	- Spring Framework (a java framework) with the MVC architecture.
	- Spring is the most popular (state of art application) java application framework for web development.
	- Considering implement Spring cloud if the workload allows.
	- Mysql for database.
	- JSP JavaScript and CSS for front end.

-Read up on development method scrum waterfall
	- Decide to use waterfull for the development because the waterfull is a linear sequential design approach
	  which is suitable for individual development. Agile(scrum) works well for team project, so not suitable.
	- Methodology tool - Gantt chart.

-Decide testing method
	- Implement unit test is very time consuming, if have enough time at the end, I would consider to do unit 
          test. Otherwise, I will only do manual test.
